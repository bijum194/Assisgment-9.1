Assignment 9.1

1. If Z is norm (mean = 0, sd = 1)
Find P(Z > 2.64)   0.9957
Find P(|Z| > 1.39) 0.9177

2. Suppose p = the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of California at Berkeley, and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has  historically had a 40% acceptance rate for its graduate school. Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from 1973. Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the officerâ..s claim, or  do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less than 40%? Use an Î± = 0.01 significance level.
